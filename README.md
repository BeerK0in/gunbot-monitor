> Monitors your GUNBOTs

**Warning - The current state of the Monitor is an early BETA version.**
So,
- it is only tested on Ubuntu and OSX
- it requires nodejs 6 and npm
- the monitor and I as creator of it are not responsible/liable for wrong numbers or wrong calculations
- it uses up to 100MB memory
- you should not use it if your server has less than 230MB available free memory
- it shows stats I'm interested in, so chances are high you'll miss some information
- it is not very efficient in parsing all the logs, so it could slow down your server
- it is only tested with Poloniex logs (I'm pretty sure it will not work for other markets)
- you need a wide window / screen
- Finally: use at own risk

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install -g gunbot-monitor
```

## Usage

```sh
$ gmon [-p /path/to/gunbot/logs]
```

Run the command inside the folder of your gunbot logs, or use `-p /path/to/gunbot/logs` to specify the path.
